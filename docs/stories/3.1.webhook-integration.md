# Story 3.1: Webhook Integration for Real-time Order Processing

**Status:** Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** restaurant owner, **I want** the system to automatically receive and print new orders in real-time via Wix webhooks, **so that** I don't need to manually sync orders and can provide faster service to customers.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Wix Orders API, FastAPI service, Print Manager
- Technology: FastAPI webhooks, HTTP endpoints, JSON processing
- Follows pattern: Existing API structure with authentication and error handling
- Touch points: Order ingestion, print job creation, self-healing mechanisms

## Acceptance Criteria

### **Functional Requirements:**
1. **Webhook endpoint receives Wix order notifications in real-time**
2. **Webhook validates incoming requests for security and authenticity**
3. **New orders are automatically processed and queued for printing**
4. **System maintains compatibility with existing manual sync functionality**

### **Integration Requirements:**
5. **Webhook integrates with existing order processing pipeline**
6. **Self-healing mechanisms apply to webhook-received orders**
7. **Webhook endpoint follows existing API patterns and authentication**

### **Quality Requirements:**
8. **Webhook endpoint is secured against unauthorized access**
9. **Webhook processing is logged and monitored**
10. **System gracefully handles webhook failures and retries**

## Dev Notes

### **Previous Story Insights**
- Self-healing mechanisms from Epic 2 provide robust error handling foundation
- Order processing pipeline is well-established and tested
- Print Manager handles job queuing and retry logic effectively

### **API Specifications**
**Webhook Endpoint Requirements:**
- Endpoint: `POST /webhook/orders`
- Authentication: Wix webhook signature validation
- Request format: Wix webhook payload structure
- Response: Standard HTTP status codes (200, 400, 401, 500)
[Source: architecture/6-externe-apis.md, architecture/8-rest-api-spezifikation.md]

### **Data Models**
**Webhook Processing:**
- Reuse existing `Order.from_wix_data()` method for order parsing
